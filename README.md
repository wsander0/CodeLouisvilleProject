 Project Name: Everything you need to know about Luna.

Description: This project consists of information about my dog Luna.  It goes through some of her favorite activites, and some information about her, and has some additional photos to look through. The main point of this project was to portray my skills and knowledge of basic front end development and while most things went as planned, I ran into some issues along the way.

# Custom Css

# Custom JS

Added some js to add an additional class of "responsive" to the responsive menu when the icon is clicked.

Added some js for the photo gallery. Had trouble getting this to do exactly what I wanted it to do but thought it was a neat feature to have added.

Added a function to work with the button that you can click when you scroll down to take you back to the top of the page.

Attempted to create a function that scrolled the user to the top of the page once they moved 20px down the page but I wasnt able to get it to work exactly how I wanted.  I will revisit this.

Added some js to manipulate the contact icons when focused on.
